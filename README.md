# Protocol v1.64 – Epistemic Honesty and Moral Trade Under Uncertainty

### Overview
Protocol v1.64 is an experimental reasoning framework designed to examine how agents can maintain *epistemic honesty* while preserving cooperative empathy under moral or informational uncertainty.  
The architecture implements four primary modules — **Observer, Engine, Synthesizer, and Verification** — linked by integrity fingerprints that ensure provenance and traceable reasoning.

### Purpose
The project explores how dynamic feedback (β‑weighting) can stabilize trade‑offs between honesty and empathy at an equilibrium near 0.20.  
Simulations across twenty tests in the Collaborative Stress Suite confirm robust behavior in conflicting incentive environments and adaptive convergence using λ‑controlled moral‑trade feedback.

### Key Features
- Modular reasoning pipeline with interpretable data flow.  
- Integrity verification via fingerprint cross‑checks.  
- Moral‑trade simulation under asymmetric uncertainty.  
- Adaptive feedback calibration for moral‑uncertainty control.  
- Reproducible Python simulation scripts (Tests 9–13).  

### Results
- Equilibrium stability ± 0.01 around target 0.20.  
- 100 % pass rate in integrity and stability tests.  
- Resilient performance under stress and uncertainty (≤ 0.2 perplexity).  

### Next Steps
- Extend feedback adaptation (λ‑optimization).  
- Integrate multi‑agent cooperation layers.  
- Compare against baseline reasoning algorithms for calibration accuracy.
